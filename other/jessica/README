Anything that is in this directory should appear at http://alexpchu.com/other/jessica/.

For example, if you have a file foo.txt, it will appear at http://alexpchu.com/other/jessica/foo.txt

Since you're part of a big file tree, you shouldn't use absolute links. That is:
Use
  <a href='pages/my_page.html'>text</a>
instead of
  <a href='http://alexpchu.com/other/jessica/pages/my_page.html>text</a>
or
  <a href='/other/jessica/pages/my_page.html>text</a>
This will ensure that your content works on other domains, when you link it with namecheap.
Regarding namecheap, you should probably use the iframe option, so that the url bar displays jessicagu.xyz instead of alexpchu.com.

Be nice. Don't use too much disk/bandwidth. Cheap server is cheap.
