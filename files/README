Platform:
---------
This software was developed for Linux.

How to Run:
-----------
To run the script, run

python chat.py

There might be a lot of error output from ALSA, but it should go away after a while.

How to Use:
-----------

First, enter your callsign so that the system can properly construct packets.
You may have to wait for ALSA to stop outputing extraneous error messages.
Enter your message following the MSG: prompt.
When a message is received, it will print to standard out (on top of the prompt) but the input is still there.

Notes:
------

The system does both transmit and receive. There is only one executable.
